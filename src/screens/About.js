        A family is not an important thing, its everything. A family is always
        one's support system, we see for our family whenever we are in trouble.
        A family provides much needed emotional, social, financial and other
        support to us. Without a family life would be unimaginably difficult and
        everyday tasks would have been impossible to achieve. The feeling that
        someone loves you and waiting for you to return safe and on time, can
        better be experienced than stated.Regardless of what form family might
        take for you, one thing is certain - family shapes us. Our family is our
        first introduction to the world. It is also our first interaction with
        it. We learn the most basic and the most important social skills from
        our family.

        This is one small gift to my family. An album is a thing that not just
        stores pictures, it is all about memories and emotions associated with
        it. Giving it a little technical touch, this e-album of my family shows
        all the amazing moments we had together, getting us to describe the
        instances of that moment that give a touch of nostalgia and bring back
        all the joy to the present. In this website, you can create new albums
        and write a short memorable description that display and moment and also
        create new posts in that particular album and mention the people in that
        pic. After all, love you FAM!!!
